## 🔥 About the Game  

Chess is a strategic board game played between two opponents. The game consists of **32 pieces**—16 per player—including kings, queens, bishops, knights, rooks, and pawns. The objective is to **checkmate** the opponent’s king, meaning the king is under attack and has no legal moves left.  

This Python-based chess game allows two players to compete in a **turn-based** manner via the command line. It enforces **legal moves**, maintains game flow, and ensures a fair match.  

## 🎯 Game Features  

- ✅ **Fully functional two-player mode** – No AI, only human vs. human  
- ✅ **Move validation** – Prevents illegal moves  
- ✅ **Real-time board updates** – See the board after every move  
- ✅ **Automatic turn switching** – No manual tracking needed  
- ✅ **Stalemate and checkmate detection** – Ends the game correctly

## 🚀 How to Play  

1. Players take turns making moves by entering chess notation (e.g., `e2 e4`).  
2. The board updates after every move.  
3. The game continues until one player wins by checkmate or a draw is declared.
